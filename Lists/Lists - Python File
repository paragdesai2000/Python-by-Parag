Story: 
As a learner of python 3, I want the ability to use List functionality on the file called "Sample File - Cars".

Requirements:
1 - Using Sample File - Cars create 3 different lists using each company description
2 - Using Sample File - Cars create a list of all MSRP values, print all MSRP values (including dollar sign), and print length of
MSRP list to console
.............................................................................................................................

#Requirement 1
hyun_lis = []
niss_lis = []
ford_lis = []

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('Company Description: The'):
        continue
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        hyun_lis.append(word)

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('Company Description: Nissan'):
        continue
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        niss_lis.append(word)

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('Company Description: Ford'):
        continue
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        ford_lis.append(word)

print(ford_lis)
print(hyun_lis)
print(niss_lis)

#Requirement 2
msrp = []

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt') #parse msrp numbers and add it to the list

for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('MSRP'):
        continue
    
    words = line.split()
    
    for word in words:
        msrp.append(words[2])
    
    for nums in msrp: #print all MSRP values (including dollar sign
        if nums == str:
            int(nums)
        print(nums)

print('MSRP is mentioned', len(msrp), 'times in this file') #print length of MSRP list
