# Python-by-Parag

#Introduction - This repositary contains a collection of my practice code and a summary of the concepts I learned in the certification I attained called Python for Everybody from University of Michigan offered through Coursera. The purpose of these files are to show my basic understanding of Python 3. My intent was to use my own content to use and not the content available from the certification. I did not want to use the same content that everyone in the class already used.
