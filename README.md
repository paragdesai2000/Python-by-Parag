# Python-by-Parag

This repository contains a collection of my practice code and summary of the concepts I learned in the Python for Everybody Certification from University of Michigan offered through Coursera. The purpose is to show my basic understanding of Python 3. 

I work in the software industry as a business analyst gathering and documenting requirements for developers to develop that is why my files have be written in a User Story format. I want to display my ability to write user stories as a BA and to develop the requirements as a learner of coding.

My intent was to create & use my own content to used and not the content available from the certification.
