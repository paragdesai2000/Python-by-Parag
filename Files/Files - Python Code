3 - Open Sample File - Cars and count how many characters exist
4 - Open Sample File - Cars and find all cars that are mentioned
5 - Open Sample File - Cars and print everything but the Company information
6 - Rewrite requirement 2 as a function
7 - Rewrite requirement 3 as a function

#Requirement 1
f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
print(f_hand)   #file handle will display here <_io.TextIOWrapper name='Sample File - Cars.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>
f_read = f_hand.read()
print(f_read)

#Requirement 2
f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
count = 0
for line in f_hand:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)

#Requirement 3
f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
f_len = len(f_hand.read())
print('File Length: ', f_len)

#Requirement 4
f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if line.startswith('Car:'):
        print(line)

#Requirement 5
f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if line.startswith('Company:'): #skip unwanted lines
        continue
    if line.startswith('Company Description:'):
        continue
    if line.startswith('Company Cars:'):
        continue
    print(line)

#Requirement 6
f_name = input('Enter file name: ')
f_hand_2 = open(f_name)
count = 0
for line in f_hand_2:
    count = count + 1
print('There are', count, 'lines in this file')

#Requirement 7
f_name = input('Enter file name: ')
f_hand_2 = open(f_name)
f_len = len(f_hand_2.read())
print('There are', f_len, 'characters in this file')
