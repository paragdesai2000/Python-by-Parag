Story: 
As a learner of python 3, I want the ability to use JSON data functionality on the file called "Sample File - Cars"

Requirements:
1 - Using Sample File - Cars loop through the file and create a dictionary for all Cars and MSRP data
2 - Write the newly created dictionary to a json file
3 - Open and print the json file (in json format)

Notes:
The purpose of this requirement is use loops to create json data, write it to a file, and print the file
If you try this script out at home please remember to change the file path

import json

cars = dict()

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('Car:'):
        continue
    words = line.split()
    cars.setdefault('Car', []).append(words[2])

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')
for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('MSRP:'):
        continue
    words2 = line.split()
    cars.setdefault('MSRP', []).append(words2[2]) #use the setdefault method to create a list as the value for a key even if that key is not already in the dictionary.

#print(cars)

cars_prices = open('C:\Coursera Courses\Python for Everybody Files\cars_prices.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8')
cars_prices_dump = json.dump(cars, cars_prices, ensure_ascii=False)
cars_prices.close()

with open('cars_prices.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    data2 = json.dumps(data, indent=2, sort_keys=True)
    print(data2)
