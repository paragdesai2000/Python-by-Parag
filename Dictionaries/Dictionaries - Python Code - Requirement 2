Story: 
As a learner of python 3, I want the ability to use Dictionaries functionality on the file called "Sample File - Cars".

Requirements:
2 - Using Sample File - Cars create a dictionary for all towing capacity mentioned in the file. Make sure to print the dictionary and the length of the dictionary

.............................................................................................................................

#Requirement 2
import string
#print(string.punctuation) #seeing which characters are considered punctuation by python

tow_cap = dict()

f_hand = open('Sample File - Cars.txt')

for line in f_hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if not line.startswith('Towing capacity:'):
        continue

    line = line.translate(line.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)) #removed the comma using punctuation function

    words2 = line.split()

    for word in words2:
        tow_cap[word] = tow_cap.get(word,0) + 1 #used the .get method to add each word into the dictionary
        
print(tow_cap)
print('There are', len(tow_cap), 'key,value pairs in the towing capacity dictionary')
